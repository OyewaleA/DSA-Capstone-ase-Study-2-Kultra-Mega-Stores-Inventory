       SUM(Sales) As [Total sale]
FROM [KMS Sql Case Study]
group by Region
order by [Total sale] desc;
```

**bottom 3 region in terms of sale**
```
SELECT TOP 3 (Region), 
       SUM(Sales) As [Total sale]
FROM [KMS Sql Case Study]
group by Region
order by [Total sale] asc;
```

       Customer_Segment,

## Recommendations
**How can KMS increase revenue from the bottom 10 customers**

```
select top 10 Customer_Name,
       Product_Category,
       Region,
       Shipping_Cost,
       Unit_Price,Discount
fROM [dbo].[KMS Sql Case Study]
order by Profit
```


-  reduce shipping cost and unit price

- increase discount and advert


**Is shipping cost aligned with order priority?**

```
Select ship_mode, 
     		sum (shipping_cost) as shipping_cost_per_shipping_mode, 
		     count (order_priority) as No_of_Order_priority
from [KMS Sql Case Study]
group by Ship_Mode
order by shipping_cost_per_shipping_mode;

select ship_mode,  sum(profit)  as [Total profit]
from [KMS Sql Case Study]
group by Ship_Mode;

select ship_mode,  (sum(profit) -  sum (shipping_cost)) as Revenue
from [KMS Sql Case Study]
group by Ship_Mode
```
- Base on the above analysis, i observed that people placed more orders (1146) using delivery truck as the mode of shipping than Express Air (983),
and if we subtract the Total shipping cost of each of the shipping mode from the Total profit, 
Express Air shipping mode has the profit of 1,060,144.61 compared to Delivery Truck which has the profit of 218,696.93.
Therefore the company made appropriate spending.
